staircase
=========

creating a staircase out of hashes and spaces in the command line

Toward the end of World 1-1 in Nintendo's Super Mario Brothers, Mario must ascend a "half-pyramid" of blocks before leaping (if he wants to maximize his score) toward a flag pole.

I  wrote a program that recreates this half-pyramid using hashes (#) for blocks given a users input. I first prompt the user for the half-pyramid's height, a non-negative integer no greater than 23. If the user fails to provide a non-negative integer no greater than 23, it should re-prompt for the same again. Once a valid number is given the program generate the desired half-pyramid. The pyramid is aligned at the bottom-left corner of the half-pyramid with the left-hand edge of the terminal window.

This program was configured for the purpose of solving a problem set from an EDX course.
